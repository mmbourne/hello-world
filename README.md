# hello-world

by Mark Bourne

I have my Ph.D in Nuclear Engineering; my fiancee has her Ph.D in Molecular Biology. The large volumes of data I've had to process and analyze has led me to a new interest in a Data Science career. My Github is where I will build my portfolio to showcase my talents to employers.
